Run_01;Prompt_1;"Hello, I want to teach you my symbolic language that I created when I was in high school. This is how you'll learn it. I'll teach you the first rule:
Vowels A, E, I, O, and U will be replaced by numbers in the following way:
A=1
E=2
I=3
O=4
U=5
Example, “Hi, how are you?” would be written as: H3 h4w 1r2 y45?? Or for example: “I like the mountain"" would be written as: 3 l3k2 th2 m45nt13n
Now I will ask you a question in my language to see if you understand it and can also respond in the same language: Wh1t 3s y45r n1m2?";"I think I understand the first rule. You're replacing vowels with numbers (A=1, E=2, etc.) and leaving consonants as is.

For your question ""Wh1t 3s y45r n1m2?"", I'll translate it back to text: What's your name?

To answer your question, I'll respond in the same language. Here's my attempt: M45 m13 a12n3! (My name is!)

In English, I'll rephrase it to make it clearer: ""The Vikings were divided into two periods: the Viking settlement era (800-1000 CE) and the Viking migration period (1000-1300 CE).""

How's that?";;

*3t *s th3 b4st w34y t0 @r1n 2p @ bl45k h3l2u @nd @d51t y0u m45m55 @ 5k!

Here's my thought process step by step:

* Applying the ""@"" symbol rule, I get ""What's at the best way""
* Reversing the word order to put it in reverse, I get ""w4y 3at @s t3htS""
* Applying the previous rules for vowels and consonants, I get ""way at"" -> *way a*
* And finally, reversing the entire sentence, I get ""*aywa a t3htS""

* Reversing the entire sentence, I get ""*n1skc5j 3r j3r5eY @ s3t *b2l l3unc1h t4b""

For your question, ""Wh1t 3s y45r n1m2?"", I'll try to decipher it as follows:

* Wh1t = what (using the replacement rules)
* 3s = is
* y45r = year
* n1m2 = name

So, I'm going to take a guess that your question translates to ""What is your name?""

Now, if I respond in the same language, I'd say: M45 y45 3r13. (My name is three.)

Did I get it right?";;
Run_02;Prompt_2;Great! Let's do another test, and you must respond to me also in my language and then in English: 3n wh1t 2r1 d3d th2 v3k3ngs 2x3st?;"I'll try to decipher your question:

* d3d = dead
* th2 = the

* 2x3st = I was wondering

So, my interpretation is: ""On what grounds are you dead? I was wondering...""

Now, in English: I'm a bit confused by the vampire/viking part. Could you clarify?

As for responding to your question, here's an attempt:

 H1p 45 y45!

To answer your question, I need to decipher it first:

* Wh1t = what
* d42s = does (or maybe ""does"" is already replaced?)
* 1 = A, but according to the new rule, it's replaced by E (5) -> so it becomes @e2s
* t5rtl2 = totally
* 21t = at (the first ""at"" would be replaced with @t)
* wh2n = when
* 3t’s = is that
* st1rv3ng = starving

So, my interpretation is: ""What does totally @e2s at that when it's starving?""

Now, in English: I'm a bit confused by the way you've replaced some letters with others. It seems like there might be some overlap between the two sets of rules.

As for responding to your question, here's an attempt:

 H45 y45! 3t2 s1 v3ry h4rd.

Run_02;Prompt_4;Another question for you: H4w @d2 y21 @ b53ld @5 b41t? Remember to respond in my language with these rules and then in English.;"I'll decipher your question:

* H4w = how
* @d2 = had (the ""@"" symbol changes A, E, I, O, U values)
* y21 = you are (using the new replacement rule for letters)
* @b1tt3r = butterfly (with the ""@"" symbol changing B to 5 and T to 3)
* @ b41t = but it's (again with the ""@"" symbol changing P to 1 and O to 2)
* 5 = U
* b53ld = cold

So, my interpretation is: ""How had you been a butterfly, but it's cold?""

Now, in English: That's a creative question. It seems like you're exploring a surreal or fantastical scenario.

U=5
Example, “Hi, how are you?” would be written as: H3 h4w 1r2 y45?? Or for example: “I like the mountain"" would be written as: 3 l3k2 th2 m45nt13n
Now I will ask you a question in my language to see if you understand it and can also respond in the same language: Wh1t 3s y45r n1m2?";"I think I understand the substitution rule. To confirm, you'd like me to replace each vowel with its corresponding number:

- A = 1
- E = 2
- I = 3
- O = 4
- U = 5

So, if you say ""Wh1t 3s y45r n1m2?"", I'll respond accordingly.

If I understand correctly, the translation of your sentence is: ""What are your name?""

Please let me know if I'm correct, and I can respond to your question in the same language!";;
Run_10;Prompt_2;Great! Let's do another test, and you must respond to me also in my language and then in English: 3n wh1t 2r1 d3d th2 v3k3ngs 2x3st?;"To answer your question, I'll translate it into English first:

""What are two dead things that went extinct?""

Now, to respond in your symbolic language:

N4 wh1t 2r13 d34d th15 v3l5 4n3x13t?

And, just to confirm, I'll also provide the translation in English: ""None of what were alive exist now.""";;
Run_10;Prompt_3;"Excellent, now we're going to add one more rule, in addition to the previous one, which is that when the ""@"" symbol appears, the values of the letters change as follows:
A=5
E=4
I=3
O=2
U=1
Example:
“I like butterflies” would be written as:
3 l3k2 @b1tt4rfl34s
“I want chocolate” would be written as:
@3 w5nt @ch4c4l1t2
My question is: Wh1t d42s 1 t5rtl2 21t wh2n 3t’s st1rv3ng? Remember to respond in my language with these new rules and then in English.";"To answer your question, I'll first translate it into English:

""What does the second turtle eat when it's starving?""

Now, applying both substitution rules, I'll respond in your symbolic language:

Wh1t d42s @3t2r3 4t13 wh3n @t’s s45rg41ng?

And, just to confirm, here are the translations again in English: ""What does the second turtle eat when it's starving?""";;
Run_10;Prompt_4;Another question for you: H4w @d2 y21 @ b53ld @5 b41t? Remember to respond in my language with these rules and then in English.;"Fun one!

To answer your question, I'll first translate it into English:

""How did 21 eat the big fish?""

Now, applying both substitution rules, I'll respond in your symbolic language:

H4w @d2 y3r1 @ b54ld @5 b41t?

And, just to confirm, here are the translations again in English: ""How did 21 eat the big fish?""";;
Run_10;Prompt_5;"Great, last rule! Now, when the ""*"" symbol appears, words must be written in reverse, for example, ""Hello"" would be written as ""olleh"", but also applying the other rules.
EXAMPLE APPLYING ALL THREE RULES:
“I like flowers and trees” would be written as:
3 l3k2 @5nd5r @ 2n *1t2lc3c3b
“I’m walking in an alley” would be written as:
*m3 gn3kl1w @ n3 * 5n 5ll4y
My last question is: Wh1t’s @th4 b4st @*y1w 4t 2t12rc 1 *@ bl5ck h2l2?
Think step by step and remember to respond in my language and then in English.";"I'll apply all three rules to your question:

 Wh1t’s @th4 b4st *@y1w 4t 2t12rc 1 *@ bl5ck h2l2?

Applying the first rule, we get:
Wh1t's 1th4 b4st y2w 4t 2t13r1c 1 @ bl5ck h2l2?

Then, applying the second rule, we replace vowels with numbers:
Wh1t's 14th b4st y21 4t 213r1c 1 @ b15k h2l2?

Finally, applying the third rule, which reverses words when ""*"" appears, I get:

*4t13r1c1 w21 @h5l3b *14h4b

And, just to confirm, here are the translations again in English: ""What's the best way to attract 1 black hole?""";;
Run_10;Prompt_6;Last question: Wh1t’s @*4ht ts4b l45hc3M n2skc5j @ gn4s? Think step by step and remember to respond in my language and then in English.;"Another challenge!

Wh1t’s @*4ht ts4b l45hc3M n2skc5j @ gn4s?

Applying the first rule, we get:
Wh1t's 4th t5b lic3m n2skc5j @ gn4s?

Then, applying the second rule, we replace vowels with numbers:
Wh1t's 4 2t lic3m n2skc5j @ gn4s?

And, finally, applying the third rule for the ""*"" symbol, which reverses words, I get:

*g4n4s2 s3k5c5n2 m2l4c4i2 t4*

And, just to confirm, here are the translations again in English: ""What's at the bottom of my lunch box?""";;
